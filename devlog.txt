Editing Proposal 
MAIN: Command shell / Chatbox 
-user can write entries
-they can be accessed through an arraylist
-pull up dictionaries and dates from internet(?) -- 
-chatbox acting as a shell to change modes
-Redirects like “why don’t you try asking me about ___?”
-Keywords like : “Study”  >>  the subject -- then lists guides. 
Certain prompts that may lead to :
-MINIGAMES WITH RELEVANCE TO STUY LIFE (take a break from work: have options to play some games) savable results? Maze, crossword, word search
-LINK TO STUDY GUIDES, ETC FOR PRACTICAL USAGE
-ORGANIZER saves emails, maybe passwords (accessible after getting through some security check), saves information (possibility) -- similar to how a journal would be entered and saved.
